=head1 NAME

Bot::ChatBots::Utils - Utility functions for Bot::ChatBots

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Bot::ChatBots qw< guard load_module resolve_module >;

   {
      my $guard = guard(sub { print 'whatever' });
   }
   # 'whatever' is printed here
   {
      my $guard = guard(sub { print 'whatever' });
      # ... do stuff...
      $guard->release; # 'whatever' is printed here
   }
   # nothing is printed here

   resolve_module('Duh');        # returns 'Bot::ChatBots::Duh'
   resolve_module('Foo::Bar');   # returns 'Foo::Bar'
   resolve_module('!Duh');       # returns 'Duh'
   resolve_module('::Foo::Bar'); # returns 'Bot::ChatBots::Foo::Bar'

   # transform $something using resolve_module, load it and return
   # the loaded class name
   load_module($something);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a few utilities for ease your way while building
stuff with Bot::ChatBots.

Nothing is exported by default.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 B<< guard >>

   my $guard = guard(sub{ ... });

Returns a guard object by calling L<Bot::ChatBots::Guard/new>.

=head2 B<< load_module >>

   my $module_name = load_module($module_name_spec);

Transforms the input C<$module_name_spec> via L</resolve_module>, then
loads the result using L<Module::Runtime/use_module> and returns the
loaded module name. This can be useful for doing things like this:

   # load Bot::ChatBots::Auth and create an instance
   my $auth = load_module('Auth')->new(users => {whitelist => {1 => 1}});

=head2 B<< pipeline >>

   my $tube = pipeline($atube); # OR
      $tube = pipeline(@specifications); # OR
      $tube = pipeline(\%opts, @specifications); # OR
      $tube = pipeline(@specifications, \%opts);

Smart wrapper around L<Data::Tubes/pipeline>.

If a single argument is provided and it is a sub reference, it is
considered to be a tube itself and returned directly. In this case, no
call to L<Data::Tubes/pipeline> is done (and L<Data::Tubes> is then not
required).

In all other cases L<Data::Tubes> is required as a dependency.

Arguments C<@specifications> must be either tubes (i.e. sub references) or
definitions that can be transformed into tubes (see L<Data::Tubes> for the
details). You can pass options with a hash reference either as the first
or the last parameter.

One option that you can pass is C<prefix>, which sets the prefix for
automatic resolution of names. This resolution is done via
L</resolve_module> and does not rely upon L<Data::Tubes>' own mechanism.
These C<\%opts> are anyway passed down to L<Data::Tubes> if you want to
set additional supported options. By default, C<%opts> is considered an
empty hash.

=head2 B<< resolve_module >>

   my $module_name = resolve_module($spec); # OR
      $module_name = resolve_module($spec, $prefix);

Transform an input C<$spec> string into a module name. Parameter
C<$prefix> is optional and defaults to C<Bot::ChatBots>. The
transformation rules are as follows:

=over

*

if C<$spec> starts with two colons C<::>, then C<$prefix . $spec> is
returned, ELSE

*

if C<$spec> starts with an exclamation point C<!>, the first character is
removed and the rest of the string is returned without further processing,
ELSE

*

if C<$spec> does NOT contain the C<::> sequence, the string C<$prefix
. '::' . $spec> is returned, ELSE

*

if none of the above apply, the provided C<$spec> is returned namely.

=back

The net result is that single names (like C<Foo> or C<WhatEver>) get
prefixed, stuff resembling a full module name are preserved, but you can
force prefixing by pre-pending C<::> or you can disable prefixing by
pre-pending an exclamation mark.
